## Development Workflow

STRICT REQUIREMENT:
- Version Control: Follow best practices with Git (feature branches, pull requests).
- Testing: All major features should include unit/integration tests.
- Iterative Development: Prioritize functional increments.
- AI Agent Collaboration:
  - Provide precise prompts.
  - Break complex tasks into smaller subtasks.
  - Expect AI adherence to rules without constant reminders.
